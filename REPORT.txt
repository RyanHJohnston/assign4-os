1. I did not collaborate with anybody on this assignment, I did this entirely on my own.

2. Honestly, I have no idea if everything I did was correct. This assignment has been the most
difficult so far and I am extremely unsure of its correctness.

3. Everything is working as needed, there are no glaring bugs. Any glaring bugs are caught by the
programs. I'm just not sure if the output is correct.

4. This was the most difficult assignment by far; because conceptually, it was very difficult to
design and implement. I spent most of my time trying to implement rather than debugging. It was
pretty difficult.

5. Below is the output of running 'make all' in the directory. Every time the makefile is executed,
this file will be appended by the output of executing the C object files.
